                <strong><span>三、Identity information and verification</span></strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>3.1 Identity information</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>3.1.1 Depending on the different jurisdictions and different entity types, the information we collect may be inconsistent. In principle, the following information will be collected from registered individuals:</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>3.1.1.1 Basic information about the individual: Your name, address (and permanent address, if different), date of birth and nationality, etc. Authentication should be based on documents issued by official or other similar authorities, such as passports, ID cards, or other identification documents required by jurisdictions. The address you provide will be verified using appropriate methods, such as checking the ticket or interest rate ticket for the passenger vehicle or checking the voter register.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>3.1.1.2 Valid photos: Before you register, you must provide a photo of your ID on your chest;</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>3.1.1.3 Contact: Phone/Mobile number and/or valid email address.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>3.1.2 If you are a company or other legal entity, we will collect the following information to determine the ultimate beneficiary of you or your trust account.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>Company registration and registration certificate; copy of the company's articles of association and memorandum; detailed evidence of the company's equity institution and ownership statement, the board of directors' decision to determine the opening of the account of the website and the execution of the authorized client; The identity document of the major shareholder and the account holder of this website; the company's main business address, if it is different from the company's mailing address, provides a mailing address. If the company's local address is inconsistent with its primary business address, it is considered a riskier customer and additional additional documentation is required.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>• Documents issued by other certifications and authorities that we require, as well as documents we deem necessary, depending on the different jurisdictions and different entity types.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>3.1.3 We only accept identity information in English or Chinese. If not, please translate your identity information into English and notarize.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>3.2 Confirmation and verification</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>3.2.1 We ask that you provide the full page of the identity document.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>3.2.2 We ask that you provide a photo of your identity document on your chest.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>3.2.3 A copy of the supporting documents shall be checked against the original documents. However, if a trusted and appropriate certifier can prove that the copy is an accurate and comprehensive copy of the original, the copy is acceptable. Such certifiers include ambassadors, judicial commissioners, local sheriffs, and so on.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>3.2.4 The requirement for identifying the ultimate beneficiary and account control is to determine which individuals ultimately own or control the direct customer, and/or to determine that the ongoing transaction is performed by someone else. In the case of a business, the identity of the major shareholder (such as those holding 10% or more of the voting interest) should be verified. In general, 25% of the shareholding will be recognized as normal risk, and the shareholder's identity must be verified; if the shareholding is 10% or if there are more voting rights or stocks that are considered high risk, the shareholder's identity must be verified.</span>

                <strong><span>四、Monitor transaction</span></strong>

            </p>
            <p>
                <span>4.2 If transactions are frequently concentrated in a registered user or there is an unreasonable situation, our professional team will assess and decide if they are suspicious;</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>4.3 In our case, we have determined that it is a suspicious transaction. We may take restrictive measures such as suspending the transaction, rejecting the transaction, and even if it is possible to reverse the transaction as soon as possible, and report to the competent authority, but will not notify you;</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>4.4 We reserve the right to refuse registrations from persons who do not meet the International AML standards or who can be considered as political public figures. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate transactions that are suspicious based on our own judgment, but we do so and do not violate any of your obligations and responsibilities to you.</span>
